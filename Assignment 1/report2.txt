**REPORT-2**

Language-Python 2.7.12

Libraries imported-
1.pandas(To use read_excel function)
2.numpy(mathematical tools)
3.xlrd(read excel file)
4.matplotlib(To plot the boxplot)

Methodology followed:
Used pandas.read_excel function to read data from excel file.Then the retrieved data is stored column-wise in different lists.The data of each column is stored in a seperate list.Then these lists is passed to five_points function which returns the following parameter.
1.min
2.max
3.mean
4.upper percentile
5.lower percentile

Then the boxplot of each data set is generated using matplotlib module.To reject outliers anothor function reject_outlier() is used. After that we have to again plot the boxplot and compare both the boxplots.
