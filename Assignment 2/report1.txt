Hypothesis proof:

Ho=The popularity of films (as imdb score) increases.
H1=The popularity of films (as imdb score) not increases.

(1)When std. deviation is known
mean=6.44
Now we can calculate the z value using the formaula.
According to which we failed to reject Ho.


(2)When std. deviation is not known
Now we can calculate the t value using the formula.
According to which we failed to reject Ho.
