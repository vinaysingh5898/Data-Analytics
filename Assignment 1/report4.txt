**REPORT-4**

Language-Python 2.7.12

Libraries imported-
1.pandas(To use read_excel function)
2.statistics(To find mean,mode,median)
3.random(To generate random values)

Methodology followed:
Firstly using pandas.read_excel function data from IRIS.xlsx has been read.Then each column data is stored in different list.population mean of each list is calculated using statistics.mean function.Then a sample of 50 data points is taken from each data set.Population variance is calculated using statistics.pvariance() function.These results have to be compared with sample variance of each column data. 
 
         sample variance vs poplation variance
sample variance:  0.685693512304 population variance :  0.6541
sample variance:  0.188004026846 population variance :  0.157284
sample variance:  3.11317941834  population variance :  2.989844
sample variance:  0.582414317673 population variance :  0.494516


population variance changes every time we execute the code since we are randomly taking 50 data sets each time.
