Database used-Customer_Churn_Data.csv

Procedure:
1.Data munging:select the predictor variables and remove unnecessary variables.
2.Split the database into training and testing set.using createDataPartition function which will give stratified sampling.
3.Using inbuilt libraries in R , model the data with following method:
	1.SVM-svm() function
	2.C5.0-C5.0() function
	3.Naive Bayesian-NaiveBayes() function
4.Use plot method to plot the ROC curves


JUSTIFICATIONS:
1.following attributes have predictor variables.They will be helpful in determinig the churn.
	international_plan attribute
	voice_mail_plan attribute
2.createDataPartition method will give stratified result(relative proportions of true and false in 
  the  target  variable  are  maintained  in  training  and  test  set).
3.classified  models  using  at  following 3  classification techniques:
	SVM , C5.0 , Naive Bayesian
4.Confusion matrices have been created.
5.Analysing the ROC curve we have observed that C5.0 is the best technique of modelling among the three techniques.
