**REPORT-1**

Language-Python 2.7.12

Libraries imported-
1.csv(To read csv data file)
2.statistics(To calculate arithmetic mean)
3.math,operator(for mathematical tools)
4.Scipy(To calculate GM,HM)

a) Carefully observe the data. Apparently what it seems?
Ans: The speed is increasing continuously and distance value is sometime increasing and sometime decreasing.

b)Which mean calculation has a real significance to the data?
Ans:speed means are AM  15.4 GM  14.3250064215 HM 12.9615258275
distance means are AM  42.98 GM  34.3261479627 HM 22.1821427266

AM mean calculation has more significance for speed.
GM mean calculation has more significance for dist.

c)Do you suggest any other measurement(s) which might be useful implications?
Ans:We can also find mode and median of data points to find the central tendency of data.

Methodology followed:
Used the csv module to read data from CARS.csv and inbuilt statistics module to calculate AM of data.Imported stats from scipy and used inbuilt functions to calculate GM and HM.
